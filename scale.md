## Scaling the Rating Functionality:

### Eventual Consistency Approach:

* Asynchronous Processing: Instead of direct database insertions, create events and push them to a queue (e.g., Kafka).
* Consumer-Driven Persistence: A consumer will save the ratings to the database in batches for improved throughput.
* Database Flexibility: The choice of database will influence the persistence strategy (e.g., one-by-one or batched).
* Long-Term Storage: For extended rating storage, consider big data solutions like Hadoop.

## Top 10 Rated Movies Calculation:

1. Batch Processing:
    1. Periodically (e.g., daily) execute a MapReduce job to calculate top 10 ratings.
    2. Store results in a permanent storage (database or blob storage).
    3. Cache calculated data for faster retrieval.
2. Stream Processing:
    1. Use a stream processing engine (e.g., KSQLDB, Spark, Flink) to calculate top 10 ratings from Kafka events.
    2. Store results in a cache (e.g., Redis) or a compacted topic.

Note: The choice between batch and stream processing depends on factors like data volume, latency requirements, and resource constraints.
Of course instead of using an out-of-box solution, this solutions can be implemented.
